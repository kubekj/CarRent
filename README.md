# CarRent
A project focused on a sports car rental business, developed collaboratively by a team of three individuals, with me in the role of team lead. The project utilizes Strapi as the backend, serving both the client-facing website and the admin/worker interface. The admin panel is designed for efficiently managing reservations and car-related tasks, while the client website provides users with the ability to browse and rent specific cars.
